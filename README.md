# Real Estate Agency site + Signup & Login

This project aimed to let users create an account and login to the website through my own created API using REST and MongoDB. Upon logging in the user will go to a real estate landing page.
Don't worry, you can create a made up account since I didn't add validation in the backend ðŸ˜Š

The project was using MongoDB and Heroku for hosting of the backend server and vanilla js + html/css for the frontend ðŸš€
